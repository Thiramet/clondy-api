## What is clondy ?
> Cloudy is the brainchild of my latest venture into the world of Golang, a personal API that I developed to put my coding skills to the test.

> As I continue to expand my expertise in Golang, I decided to take on a new challenge: building my very own API from scratch. And thus, Cloudy was born.

> For those curious about my Golang proficiency, I present to you Cloudy - a custom API I created to push the boundaries of my coding capabilities.

> With Cloudy, I sought to not only gauge my current level of Golang proficiency but also to explore new frontiers and deepen my knowledge of this versatile language.

> Cloudy represents the culmination of countless hours spent honing my skills in Golang. It's a testament to my commitment to excellence and passion for software development.
